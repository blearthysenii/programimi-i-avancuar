# AI-Assisted Hello World

## Language Choice
I chose Python because it is easy to learn and has a simple syntax, making it ideal for beginners and for quickly prototyping code.

## AI Tool Used
I used ChatGPT to assist with coding.

## The AI Experience
Here's how I used the AI tool and what I discovered:

- **What worked well:**
  - ChatGPT provided a clear structure for the program, with a focus on handling user input and working with datetime.
  - The AI suggested the `input()` function to collect the user's name and `datetime` for showing the current time, which was very helpful.
  
- **What didn't work well:**
  - I had to make some adjustments in terms of handling invalid input and ensuring that an empty name would be rejected.
  - The AI didn't suggest using a recursive function to ask for the name again if it was invalid, which I added manually.

- **Modifications I made:**
  - I added error handling to ensure that the name input isn't empty. If the user doesn't provide a name, the program asks again.
  - I also added comments to explain each part of the code more clearly.

## What I Learned
This exercise gave me a better understanding of how AI tools like ChatGPT can speed up coding by providing quick solutions, though some manual adjustments are often necessary to ensure that the code meets specific requirements or edge cases. I also learned how to effectively integrate error handling into a simple Python script.
